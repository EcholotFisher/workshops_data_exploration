98748,US,"Pineapple fruit rings out loud and clear, with a slightly grainy, though not sweet, entrance.

55390,Argentina,"Dark-berry fruits, tomato and herbs make for a bouquet with ample power and varietal correctness. Big, blocky and fiercely tannic, this Cabernet tastes of roasted black fruits. A finish with heat, spice, oak-based clove and mint notes confirms a high level of oak that for the most part this can handle.",Maipe Reserve,88,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Chakana 2014 Maipe Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),Cabernet Sauvignon,Chakana
86214,US,"Dry and a little unripe, this has a vegetal streak that compromises the nectarine and citrus flavors. A fine burst of acidity makes the mouth water. The blend is mainly Sémillon, with a little Sauvignon Blanc.",Cuvée Blanc,85,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,Palazzo Wine 2011 Cuvée Blanc White (Napa Valley),Bordeaux-style White Blend,Palazzo Wine
65599,US,"More flavorful than the rather light color might indicate, this sophisticated wine has wonderful, complex aromas like leather, tea and chocolate. Vibrant flavors of raspberry and pomegranate partner with an appetizingly dry and slightly tannic texture. It is medium to full bodied.",,92,29.0,California,Red Hills Lake County,,Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,Sol Rouge 2012 Mourvèdre (Red Hills Lake County),Mourvèdre,Sol Rouge

84922,Spain,"For a Valencia D.O. wine, this is darn appealing. The nose is warm, rooty and smells of cola nut, fresh raisins and cassis, while the driving palate offers roasted black fruit flavors along with sweet tomato and herbs. Drying and tannic on the finish, but balanced. Neither cooked nor overweight. Drink now through 2011.",N° 12 Selección Especial,90,35.0,Levante,Valencia,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Venta del Puerto 2006 N° 12 Selección Especial Red (Valencia),Red Blend,Venta del Puerto

20254,US,"A scintillating scent of rose petals opens up this pleasing wine, which continues with raspberry and cherry fruit, accented with light milk chocolate. It is not a heavy wine; in fact, if Franc can ever be called elegant, even feminine, this is how it should taste. The finish falls off rather quickly, but otherwise it is a fine effort.",Beverly Vineyard Reserve,87,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Columbia Crest 2005 Beverly Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Cabernet Franc,Columbia Crest

114576,South Africa,"This blend of 60% Syrah, 25% Grenache and 15% Mourvèdre is plush and brooding, with dense aromas and flavors of macerated blackberry, black plum and boysenberry that are laced with hints of bramble, violet and baking spice. The medium-weight palate boasts approachable tannins, ripe black-fruit flavors and a crushed satin texture. Notes of black tea, pepper and licorice grace the long finish.

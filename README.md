# workshops_data_exploration
In the first part of the workshop the focus is on understanding basic the concepts of data exploration. What to look for in the data and what are the tools.

## Looking at the data

In summary and in detail. For summary look we have two main ways: histogram and 5 number summary, which is visualised as a boxplot. 

Boxplot are also useful for comparing many groups of data or time series groups.

In Exercise 1 pick a dataset from the [datasets](datasets) folder and calculate: min, max, median and quartiles and draw a boxplot. What does it look like? 

Do it now in Python by following the notebook in [Data Summaries](notebooks/Data_summaries.ipynb)

Looking at the data in detail we would need to plot the data differently, for example by using scatter plots.

Usually we try to compare a variable to another, for example height with age, this comparison can be measured via correlation.

For plotting different data distributions look at the notebook in [Data Details and Relationships](notebooks/Data_Details_and_Relationships.ipynb).
